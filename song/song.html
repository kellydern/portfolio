  <h1>Client Brand Guidelines</h1>
  	<p>When we start collaboration on a client project, we must first define their brand characteristics for white-labeling and how to use their brand assets within our app.</p>
  <h3>Client Logo</h3>
  	<p>We require the logo as an SVG or EPS format. Because of the horizontal space within our navigation, it’s preferable that the logo is also in a horizontal (as opposed to stacked) format.</p>
  <h3>Client Brand Variables</h3>
  	<ul>
  		<li><span class="StyleEmphasis">$color-primary</span>: This is the client’s main color. This color will be used for the container headers, icons, backgrounds, and sometimes secondary buttons styles. If their main color is too jarring, such as a bright red, or another alarming color, we will determine whether a different color in their brand style guide is more appropriate.</li>
  		<li>$color-secondary: The secondary color can be used as their main action color within the app. This color should be complementary to the $color-primary, and should be used as action states, such as buttons, links, clickable icons, or secondary actions throughout the app.</li>
  		<li>$color-tertiary: This color can be used for secondary actions, such as clickable icons, secondary button styles or other unclickable icons.</li>
